I have encountered situations in which

is was not convenient or possible to

complete certain tasks while I was

signed in to the MySQL server.

For instance, I may have needed to

run a query and have the results

available in a text file.

Let's say that I want all

the employees' IDs and their

First and Last Name.

I can execute a mysql command

from the command line.

I have attached the exact commmand

as a resource to this lecture.

It's possible to get much

more clever than that, though.

Consider the need to change

all the tables in a database

to use the InnoDB engine.

I can create a script

for mysql to run

by executing a mysql command.

I have attached the exact commmand

as a resource to this lecture.

The command has created the

ConvertToInnoDB.sql file.

Now I can edit that file to

remove the first line.

Then I can run the command

mysql -u root -p mydatabase < ConvertToInnoDB.sql

Anything that you can do

while logged in to the MySQL server

can be done via the --execute option

of the mysql command.

These two examples should

give you a bit of inspiration

about clever ways you can

a variety of different tasks.

I hope you've enjoyed them

and would love to see examples

you've created.

Please post them as discussion topics

for this lecture!

See you in the next lecture!
