If you don't back up your data

then it doesn't exist.

It's too late to think about

doing a backup once

your site has been hacked

or your data has been corrupted or deleted.

The documentation page provides

a long list of options as well as

many paragraphs of explanations.

Odds are good, though, that

you will be perfectly fine using:

mysqldump --user=root --password mydatabase > mydatabasebackup.sql

Note that I didn't sign in to

the MySQL server to do this.

I passed the user information in

with the --user option and

instructed the MySQL server to

prompt for the password.

You may also need to use the --host option.

Once the command had finished running

I had a file named mydatabasebackup.sql

on my computer.

As long as I've now got a backup

I might as well test restoring it.

I'm going to restore it directly

to the same database.

You might wish to first

create a test database and

restore into the test database.

I can restore a database

by executing the statement:

mysql -u root -p mydatabase < mydatabasebackup.sql

It's a good idea to test backing up and restoring databases

because if you've got a problem with

your backup or restore process

it's too late to find that out when

you've had a problem with your data

and you really need the backup.
