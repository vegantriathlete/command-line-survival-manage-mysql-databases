Welcome to Command Line Survival: Manage MySQL Databases With Ease!

I'm Marc Isaacson and I'm your instructor.

I'm thrilled to have you as a student.

Congratulations on choosing to enhance your command line acumen.

I know it's sometimes a daunting choice to make.

When I first started in web development

I relied on tools like phpMyAdmin or Chive.

There was a time that I had joked with a colleague

that if I couldn't use them,

I would just tell a client that

they were out of luck.

I was only half-joking, though.

I was a bit nervous about what I'd do

if I had to deal with MySQL databases

from the command line.

I had visions of needing to spend

hours using search engines

to figure out how to use

the proper commands.

Well, the good news is

that it doesn't take hours

of using search engines!

This course walks you through

all the basic commands you will

need to know.

It even includes some "extra" commands

that may come in handy from time to time.

And, you can make it through the whole course

in just one brief sitting!

There are three main sections for the commands.

The first section teaches you all the basic commands.

The next section teaches you about backing up

and restoring databases.

Then there is a section that includes some

slightly more advanced commands.

Each of the sections concludes with a

practice activity or quiz to help you

solidify your understanding.

Don't worry, they all come with answer sheets.

And whenever you need more help, you can

create a post in the Discussion section.

You're in good hands!

Are you ready to get started?

Let's get rolling!
