All the data in a database

is stored inside tables.

Tables are comprised of columns and rows.

When you create a table,

one of the things you must do

is to define the columns.

As data is stored in the table

new rows are added.

Since this is a beginner course,

I will cover only a few simple

examples of defining a table.

Once I am logged in to the MySQL server

I will choose a database to use by entering

USE mydatabase;

Even though it is possible to explicitly state

in which database you wish to

create a table when you are creating it,

choosing the database first saves

a bit of typing when you have to

define many tables.

See the resources attached to this lecture

for a document that illustrates

the tables I will create

in the following examples.

For all of the examples

I will break the statement apart

into multiple lines so

that it's easier for you to read.

First I will create the employee table.

I have attached a resource

to this lecture with

the exact statement I've used.

One important point to note

is that I had to name

the Terminated Date column

something other than "terminated"

because TERMINATED is a reserved word.

I can use

DESC employee;

to describe the table I just created.

You will notice that

there is no information about the comment column.

I can display that information by

querying the information_schema database,

that the MySQL server maintains,

with the following SELECT statement.

I have attached a resource to this lecture

with the exact statement.

Next I will create the employee_hours table.

I have attached a resource to this lecture

with the exact statement.

For this table,

in addition to using the id column

as the primary key,

I have another compound key.

Notice that I used the UNIQUE reserved word.

Also, since the key is comprised of multiple columns,

I need to specify it on its own.

I do not need to specify a separate key

for the id column because

the MySQL server can make use of

the key that I already specified.

This is because id is the first

part of the key.
