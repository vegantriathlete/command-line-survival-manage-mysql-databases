A Database is a container

for a set of Tables.

A Database is implemented on the computer

as a directory that holds a bunch of files.

The first thing you need to do

before you can start storing

any data on the computer

is to create a database.

If you look at the syntax

for creating a database,

you will see that there are

two optional specifications:

a character set and

a collation methodology.

I will not be discussing

character sets and collation

in this course, as it can

become quite complicated

on account of the fact that

not only tables can have their own

character set and collation

but so can the columns in the tables.

In general, unless you have a particular need

to specify the character set or collation

you will be fine to simply create the database.

First, I will sign in to the MySQL server.

The MySQL server doesn't care whether

you use upper or lower case characters.

But, it can be helpful for you to

get into the habit of writing

keywords in all upper case

and that is what I am going to do

with my examples.

Before I create the database,

I will show you the existing databases

by typing

SHOW DATABASES;

Note that I had to place

a semicolon at the end of the statement.

Also note that I have used

upper case to signal to you

which parts are keywords.

In this case, both things were keywords.

Now I will create another database

by typing

CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

substituting the actual name

of the database I want to create

for the "mydatabase" placeholder.

Note that I entered my database name

in lower case to signal to you

that it is not a keyword,

whereas the other two words were upper case.

Once again, I completed the statement

with a semicolon.

The server returned a message

to let me know that the database was created.

I can now see the database when I use

SHOW DATABASES;

If I want to delete the database I use

DROP DATABASE mydatabase;

The server gives me a message

to let me know that the database was deleted.

Now when I run the

SHOW DATABASES;

command I see that the database no longer exists.

I'll finish this lesson by

creating the database once more

so that it's ready for the rest of the course.

See you in the next lecture!
